    _Last updated: #date %Y-%m-%d_

    <br><br>
    The Registry System Testing (RST-API) provides a
    [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) interface to ICANN's [Registry
    System Testing](https://www.icann.org/resources/registry-system-testing)
    platform, which is used to conduct conformance tests of [critical registry
    functions](https://www.icann.org/registry-transition-processes-en#:~:text=Critical%20Functions:,registry%20data%20escrow)
    at various points during the lifecycle of a gTLD (before initial delegation,
    before the [transition to a new Registry Service
    Provider](https://www.icann.org/resources/material-subcontracting-arrangement),
    or before the approval of new [registry
    services](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/rsep-2014-02-19-en)). It
    will also used by the forthcoming [Registry Service Provider (RSP)
    Pre-Evaluation Program](https://community.icann.org/display/SPIR/RSP+%7C+Registry+Service+Provider+Pre-Evaluation).

    ### Workflow overview

    The sequence diagram below describes the process by which tests are
    scheduled, configured, and executed, in the context of the RSP Evaluation
    Program:

    * [High-level workflow](etc/workflow.svg)

    ### State diagram

    Each test request object has a `status` property (see the `testStatus`
    schema below) indicating its position in the test lifecycle. The following
    state diagram describes this lifecycle:

    * [State diagram](etc/test-object-state-machine.svg)

    ### Role-based access control

    This API implements Role-Based Access Control, where access to certain
    operations is restricted based on the role that is assigned to a user. For
    example, external users cannot create new test request objects in the
    production environment, but can in OT&E.

    ### Authentication

    All access to the API is authenticated using TLS certificates that are
    authenticated using `TLSA` records published in the DNS. Test request
    objects are associated with DNS hostnames; if a user presents a
    certificate which matches one of the `TLSA` records published in the DNS at
    one of these hostnames, it will be permitted to perform operations on that
    object.

    #### Internal users

    Internal users must use a certificate that matches a `TLSA` record
    found at a hard-coded DNS hostname *(the exact name is yet to be
    determined)*.

    ### HTTP status codes

    In addition to the HTTP status codes described in the operations
    specifications below, all operations may respond to requests with one of the
    following HTTP status codes:

    * **400:** returned when the server receives a malformed request.
    * **403:** returned when the access control policy prevents access.
    * **404:** returned when the resource does not exist.
    * **405:** returned when the request method is invalid.
    * **409:** returned when the client attempts to overwrite an resource that
      already exists.
    * **429:** returned when the client has exceeded rate limits.
    * **504:** returned when an intermediate proxy experiences an error.
    * **500:** returned when there has been an internal server error.

    ### Change Log

    * 2023-02-28:
      * To work better with code generators, the following changes have been
        made:
        * The specification conforms to version `3.0.3` of the OpenAPI
          specification.
        * `testCaseLog` objects:
          * the `code` and `codeRef` properties are now optional instead of
            nullable.
          * the `context` property has been changed so that property values are
            always strings.
        * The `securitySchemes` property has been removed, since code generators
          don't seem to offer good support for mutual TLS. The requirement for
          client TLS authentication has not changed, however.
        * All usages of the `patternProperties`  feature of JSON Schema have
          been changed to avoid their use. Some may still be present in the
          input parameters.
      * Changes to IDN table objects:
        * the `variants` property of entries in the `validLabels` property of
          `idnTable` objects has been changed to an array of objects, so the
          corresponding language tag can be included.
        * the `lgrXML` property of `idnTable` object has been removed.
        * Renamed the `supportLevel` property to `variantSupportLevel`.
      * As per the last release, only a single YAML file is now built from the
        source file, that contains both "internal" and "external" endpoints. The
        "internal" view is no longer published.
    * 2023-02-21:
      * Test properties (such as `applicationId` and `rsp`) that were previously
        ignored in OT&E now **MUST** be omitted.
      * When IDN table objects are created in OT&E, they **MUST** have a
        `isReferenceLGR` property that is `true`.
      * Simplified object schemas by marking properties as required (and others
        as therefore optional) avoiding the need to have nullable properties.
      * IDN tables are now referenced by a unique ID rather than the `{rsp, tag,
        version}` triple.
      * The internal and external views are now identical. The separate files
        will be removed in the next release.
      * Removed redundant `type` properties for types which have an `enum`
        property.
      * Added the `supportLevel` property to the `idnTableRef` type.
      * Some IDN table management endpoints are now accessible to external
        clients.
      * Make access control policies clearer and more consistent.
      * Remove `DELETE /tests/{id}` endpoint.
      * Fix schema definition for the `Location` header in `POST /test`
        responses.
      * Changes only relevant to internal users:
        * Change the `client` parameter to `GET /tests` to `rsp`.
        * Reinstate query parameters for `GET /tables`.
        * The `PATCH /test/{id}` endpoint has been replaced with `POST
          /test/{id}/run` and `POST /test/{id}/result`.
        * Simplified IDN table management, so that test labels are provided when
          the table object is created.

    * 2024-02-14:
      * Switch to a weekly release cycle.
      * Use a date-based version number instead of a commit-based version, ahead
        of switching to a weekly release cycle.

    * 2024-01-31:
      * Add this change log.
      * Minimise the delta between the internal and external view.
