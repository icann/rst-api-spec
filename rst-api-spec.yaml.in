  description: |
    The Registry System Testing (RST-API) provides a
    [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) interface to ICANN's [Registry
    System Testing](https://www.icann.org/resources/registry-system-testing-v2.0)
    platform, which is used to conduct conformance tests of [critical registry
    functions](https://www.icann.org/registry-transition-processes-en#:~:text=Critical%20Functions:,registry%20data%20escrow)
    at various points during the lifecycle of a gTLD (before initial delegation,
    before the [transition to a new Registry Service
    Provider](https://www.icann.org/resources/material-subcontracting-arrangement),
    before the approval of new [registry
    services](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/rsep-2014-02-19-en)), and
    during [RSP evaluation](https://newgtldprogram.icann.org/en/application-rounds/round2/rsp).

    ### Change Log

    * v2025.08 (2025-12-05):
      * The `DELETE /v1/test/{id}` API endpoint has been added
        ([#28](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/issues/28))

    * v2025.07 (2025-11-26):
      * Update description of the rsp property
        ([#32](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/issues/32))

    * v2025.06 (2025-10-02):
      * Require at least one value in `permittedVariantPolicies`
        ([#26](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/pull/26))

      * add the `DELETE /v1/test/{id}/run/{runID}` API endpoint
        ([#15](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/pull/15))

    * v2025.05 (2025-09-01):
      * This version incorporates the test plans, error codes and other
        information from [v2025.06 of the RST test
        specifications](https://github.com/icann/rst-test-specs/releases/tag/v2025.06).

      * Add `x-constraints` properties to `idnTableRequest.tag`,
        `idnTestLabel.variantTLDAllocatability` and
        `idnVariantLabel.variantTLDAllocatability` to allow additional
        validation of provided values (see
        [#18](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/issues/18)).

      * Remove `novar` as permitted value for `variantPolicy` (see
        [#20](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/issues/20)).

    * v2025.04 (2025-08-14):
      * This version incorporates the test plans, error codes and other
        information from [v2025.05 of the RST test
        specifications](https://github.com/icann/rst-test-specs/releases/tag/v2025.05).
        There are no other changes.

    * v2025.03 (2025-07-09):
      * This version incorporates the test plans, error codes and other
        information from [v2025.04 of the RST test
        specifications](https://github.com/icann/rst-test-specs/releases/tag/v2025.04)
        (see [#7](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/issues/7)).

      * The `description` property has been removed from the `testCaseLog`
        schema (see [#12](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/issues/12)).

      * Correct documentation of the `POST /v1/test` endpoint to confirm that
        the `rsp` property **MUST** be omitted (see
        [#10](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/issues/10)).

    * v2025.02 (2025-04-10):
      * Update documentation for the `/v1/heartbeat` and `/v1/resource/{file}`
        endpoints, as due to a technical limitation, they can only be accessed
        by authenticated clients.

    * v2025.01 (2025-03-27):
      * This is the first stable release of the RST v2.0 API specification.
        There are no changes to the spec other than the version number.
      * To see the log of changes prior to this version, [click
        here](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/blob/main/etc/pre-v2025.01-changelog.md).

    ### Authentication

    All access to the API is authenticated using TLS certificates that are
    authenticated using `TLSA` records published in the DNS. For more
    information, please consult [the RST v2.0 page on the ICANN
    website](https://www.icann.org/resources/registry-system-testing-v2.0/#authentication-and-access-control).

        This operation deletes an IDN table object.

        External users can only access IDN tables that are linked to test
        objects associated with their credentials.

        This operation is not available to external users in production, but may
        be used in OT&E.

    testStatus:
      description: |
        A string indicating the status of a test request object.

        1. The `inputs-needed` value indicates that the request has been
           received, but one or more input parameters are needed before a test
           run can begin. The `missingInputs` property of the test indicates
           which input parameters are missing.
        2. The `files-needed` value indicates that the request has been
           received, but one or more files are needed before the a test run can
           begin. The `missingFiles` property of the test indicates which files
           are missing.
        3. The `inputs-complete` value indicates that all the required
           input parameters and files have been provided. The test is therefore
           ready to start. It is still possible to update input parameters if
           the test has this status.
        4. The `in-progress` value indicates that a test run is in progress.
        5. The `completed` value indicates that the test run has completed. If
           a test object has this status, then its `result` property will
           indicate the outcome of the test.
        6. The `expired` value indicates that the test did not have a status
           of `completed` when the `dueDate` was reached.

        A string indicating the result of a test run.

        1. If no test run has been requested for a test object, this property
           will be `not-started`.
        2. The `in-progress` value indicates that the test run has not yet
           finished.
        3. The `pass` value indicates that the test run completed with no
           errors.
        4. The `fail` value indicates that at least one test case failed.
        5. The `exception` value indicates that an internal issue prevented
           the test run from completing.
        6. The `cancelled` value indicates that the test was cancelled by an
           administrator.
