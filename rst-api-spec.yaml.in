    <br><br>
    The Registry System Testing (RST-API) provides a
    [RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) interface to ICANN's [Registry
    System Testing](https://www.icann.org/resources/registry-system-testing)
    platform, which is used to conduct conformance tests of [critical registry
    functions](https://www.icann.org/registry-transition-processes-en#:~:text=Critical%20Functions:,registry%20data%20escrow)
    at various points during the lifecycle of a gTLD (before initial delegation,
    before the [transition to a new Registry Service
    Provider](https://www.icann.org/resources/material-subcontracting-arrangement),
    or before the approval of new [registry
    services](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/rsep-2014-02-19-en)). It
    will also used by the forthcoming [Registry Service Provider (RSP)
    Pre-Evaluation Program](https://community.icann.org/display/SPIR/RSP+%7C+Registry+Service+Provider+Pre-Evaluation).

    ### Workflow overview

    The sequence diagram below describes the process by which tests are
    scheduled, configured, and executed, in the context of the RSP Evaluation
    Program:

    * [High-level workflow](https://icann.github.io/rst-api-spec/etc/workflow.svg)

    ### State diagram

    Each test request object has a `status` property (see the `testStatus`
    schema below) indicating its position in the test lifecycle. The following
    state diagram describes this lifecycle:

    * [State diagram](https://icann.github.io/rst-api-spec/etc/test-object-state-machine.svg)

    ### Role-based access control

    This API implements Role-Based Access Control, where access to certain
    operations is restricted based on the role that is assigned to a user. For
    example, external users cannot create new test request objects in the
    production environment, but can in OT&E.

    ### Authentication

    All access to the API is authenticated using TLS certificates that are
    authenticated using `TLSA` records published in the DNS. Test request
    objects are associated with DNS hostnames; if a user presents a
    certificate which matches one of the `TLSA` records published in the DNS at
    one of these hostnames, it will be permitted to perform operations on that
    object.

    #### Internal users

    Internal users must use a certificate that matches a `TLSA` record
    found at a hard-coded DNS hostname *(the exact name is yet to be
    determined)*.

    ### Change Log

    * 2024-05-22:
      * added the `errorCode` property to `rstError` objects.
    * 2024-05-16:
      * Significant overhaul of the structure of the `idnTableRef`,
        `idnTableRequest` and `idnTable` schemas, based on internal discussions
        regarding requirements for IDN variants. A reference implementation of
        the algorithm for computing lists of test domains is also [available in
        the GitHub repository](https://github.com/icann/rst-api-spec/blob/dev/etc/idn-test-reference.js).
      * Added the `idnOnly` property to `tldInfo` objects.
      * Defined a new `rstError` object type which describes the response body
        used whenever there is an error.
      * Clarified that input parameters can still be submitted when a test
        has the `inputs-complete` status.
      * Added the `heartbeat` operation to test that the service is up.
      * Moved the `/v1` prefix from the `servers` part of the spec into the 
        individual `paths`.
      * Extract the schema for files included in `testRequestSubmitted` into
        `fileRef`.
    * 2024-03-20:
      * The `id` property of `testRequestSubmitted` objects is now a string, not
        and integer.
    * 2024-03-13:
      * Variant labels in an IDN table may have exceptional allocation policies
        when allocated in the same TLD as the primary label, or in a variant
        TLD.
    * 2024-03-06:
      * the `caseId` property of the `testCaseLog` object, and the `code`
        property of the `testCaseLogMessage` object are now enums, which are
        generated from the test specs.
    * 2024-02-28:
      * As per the last release, only a single YAML file is now built from the
        source file, that contains both "internal" and "external" endpoints. The
        "internal" view is no longer published.
      * To work better with code generators, the following changes have been
        made:
        * The specification now conforms to [v3.0.3](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3)
          of the OpenAPI specification instead of v3.1.0. This means that many
          aspects of the API specification and object schemas (including those
          of input parameters) have been changed to avoid using features only
          available in v3.1.0 of the OpenAPI spec. This includes the `examples`
          property for all JSON types, which means that the examples shown in
          the HTML representation of the API spec are now less useful than they
          were previously.
        * The following changes have been made to `testCaseLog` objects:
          * The `code` and `codeRef` properties are now optional instead of
            nullable.
          * The `context` property has been changed so that property values are
            always strings.
        * The `securitySchemes` property has been removed, since code generators
          don't seem to offer good support for mutual TLS. The requirement for
          client TLS authentication has not changed, however.
        * All usages of the `patternProperties`  feature of JSON Schema have
          been changed to avoid their use. Some may still be present in the
          input parameters.
      * Changes to IDN table objects:
        * The `variants` property of entries in the `validLabels` property of
          `idnTable` objects has been changed to an array of objects, so the
          corresponding language tag can be included.
        * The `lgrXML` property of `idnTable` object has been removed.
        * Renamed the `supportLevel` property to `variantSupportLevel`.
        * The operation to create a new IDN table object uses `idnTableRequest`
          as the request body payload, which does not allow for inclusion of
          server-generated object properties.
        * In OT&E, only Reference Second-Level LGRs can be used.
      * `type` properties for `enum` types have been reinstated.
    * 2024-02-21:
      * Test properties (such as `applicationId` and `rsp`) that were previously
        ignored in OT&E now **MUST** be omitted.
      * When IDN table objects are created in OT&E, they **MUST** have a
        `isReferenceLGR` property that is `true`.
      * Simplified object schemas by marking properties as required (and others
        as therefore optional) avoiding the need to have nullable properties.
      * IDN tables are now referenced by a unique ID rather than the `{rsp, tag,
        version}` triple.
      * The internal and external views are now identical. The separate files
        will be removed in the next release.
      * Added the `supportLevel` property to the `idnTableRef` type.
      * Some IDN table management endpoints are now accessible to external
        clients.
      * Make access control policies clearer and more consistent.
      * Remove `DELETE /tests/{id}` endpoint.
      * Fix schema definition for the `Location` header in `POST /test`
        responses.
      * Changes only relevant to internal users:
        * Change the `client` parameter to `GET /tests` to `rsp`.
        * Reinstate query parameters for `GET /tables`.
        * The `PATCH /test/{id}` endpoint has been replaced with `POST
          /test/{id}/run` and `POST /test/{id}/result`.
        * Simplified IDN table management, so that test labels are provided when
          the table object is created.

    * 2024-02-14:
      * Switch to a weekly release cycle.
      * Use a date-based version number instead of a commit-based version, ahead
        of switching to a weekly release cycle.

    * 2024-01-31:
      * Add this change log.
      * Minimise the delta between the internal and external view.

           begin.

           input parameters and files have been provided. The test is therefore
           ready to start. It is still possible to update input parameters if
           the test has this status.
        3. The `in-progress` value indicates that a test run is in progress.
        4. The `completed` value indicates that the test run has completed. If
           a test object has this status, then its `result` property will
           indicate the outcome of the test.
        5. The `expired` value indicates that the test did not have a status
           of `completed` when the `dueDate` was reached.
