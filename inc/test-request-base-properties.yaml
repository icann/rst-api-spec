applicationID:
  description: |
    For RSP evaluation, the application ID, otherwise it should be
    omitted. In OT&E, this **MUST** be omitted  when creating a new test
    request.
  type: string
  example: a6e91182-5c63-415c-87dd-2d0902578cd5

rsp:
  description: |
    The RSP's unique ID.

    In OT&E, this **MUST** contain the Fully-Qualified Domain Name where a TLSA
    record that validates the client certificate is published.
  type: string
  example: RSPI2404-M51

tlds:
  description: |
    This structure describes the TLDs to which the test relates. It is
    an array which contains an array of logically grouped TLDs (such as
    those with a variant relationship).

    Simple example of an ASCII TLD with no IDN tables:
    ```
    {
      "tlds": [
        [
          {
            "name": "example",
            "idnTables": []
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
    ```

    In RSP testing, this property will only contain a single TLD, but more
    complex sets of TLDs with variants are supported for pre-delegation testing.

    Example of an ASCII TLD with one or more IDN tables:
    ```
    {
      "tlds": [
        [
          {
            "name": "example",
            "idnTables": [
              {
                "id": "06e6ab5b-0e7a-4ff2-8e67-d6320e5ef4b7",
                "variantPolicy": "novar"
              },
              {
                "id": "25eb306b-1fb0-4def-bf01-fa18815f614b",
                "variantPolicy": "novar"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
    ```

    Example of a set of variant TLDs:
    ```
    {
      "tlds": [
        [
          {
            "name": "xn--8pvxs",
            "idnTables": [
              {
                "id": "06e6ab5b-0e7a-4ff2-8e67-d6320e5ef4b7",
                "variantPolicy": "mayallocatevar"
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "name": "xn--8pvz8d",
            "idnTables": [
              {
                "id": "3f60939b-b7bf-46db-9004-126bf08923af",
                "variantPolicy": "mayallocatevar"
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
    ```

    All the IDN tables referenced in this property **MUST** already
    exist when the test object is created. In OT&E, users can create IDN table
    obejcts, but these **MUST** correspond to Second-Level Reference LGRs:
    custom IDN tables cannot be used.

    If a TLD offers registrations at the third or higher levels, then at
    least one second-level "registry-class" domain name(s) should be
    separately listed, rather than the TLD itself.

clientIDs:
  description: |
    An array of FQDNs at which one or more `TLSA` records may be found
    which can be used for authentication.

    In OT&E, this **MUST** contain the Fully-Qualified Domain Name where a TLSA
    record that validates the client certificate is published, and **MAY**
    contain other IDs.

dueDate:
  description: |
    The date/time before which the test must be passed. If not provided, the
    test remains open indefinitely (unless the `completed` status is reached).

    In OT&E, this **MUST** be omitted when creating a new test request.
