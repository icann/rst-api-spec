applicationID:
  description: |
    For RSP evaluation, the application ID, otherwise it should be
    omitted. In OT&E, this **MUST** be omitted.
  type: string
  examples: [fd327b44-b818-4f37-9349-a15bc5f230da]

rsp:
  description: |
    The RSP's unique ID.

    In OT&E, this **MUST** be omitted, and will be populated using the
    FQDN of the first `TLSA` record which matches the certificate
    presented by the client.
  type: string
  examples: ["RSP2312-M51", "tlsa.rsp.tech"]

tlds:
  description: |
    This structure describes the TLDs to which the test relates. It is
    an array which contains an array of logically grouped TLDs (such as
    those with a variant relationship).

    Simple example of an ASCII TLD with no IDN tables:
    ```
    {
      "tlds": [
        [
          {
            "string": "example",
            "idnTables": []
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
    ```

    In RSP testing testing, this property will only contain a single
    TLD, but more complex sets of TLDs with variants are supported for
    pre-delegation testing.

    Example of an ASCII TLD with one or more IDN tables:
    ```
    {
      "tlds": [
        [
          {
            "string": "example",
            "idnTables": [
              {
                "id": "06e6ab5b-0e7a-4ff2-8e67-d6320e5ef4b7",
                "variantSupportLevel": 0,
              },
              {
                "id": "25eb306b-1fb0-4def-bf01-fa18815f614b",
                "variantSupportLevel": 0,
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
    ```

    Example of a set of variant TLDs:
    ```
    {
      "tlds": [
        [
          {
            "string": "xn--8pvxs",
            "idnTables": [
              {
                "id": "06e6ab5b-0e7a-4ff2-8e67-d6320e5ef4b7",
                "variantSupportLevel": 3,
              }
            ]
          },
          {
            "string": "xn--8pvz8d",
            "idnTables": [
              {
                "id": "3f60939b-b7bf-46db-9004-126bf08923af",
                "variantSupportLevel": 3,
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
    ```

    All the IDN tables referenced in this property **MUST** already
    exist when the test object is created. In OT&E, 

    If a TLD offers registrations at the third or higher levels, then at
    least one second-level "registry-class" domain name(s) should be
    separately listed, rather than the TLD itself.

clientIDs:
  description: |
    An array of FQDNs at which one or more `TLSA` records may be found
    which can be used for authentication.

    In OT&E, this **MUST** be omitted, but the resulting test will be
    populated with the FQDN of the first `TLSA` record which matches the
    certificate presented by the client.
  type: array
  items:

testPlan:
  description: |
    The test plan to be followed. A list of test plans and the permitted
    values for this property may be found at
    <https://icann.github.io/rst-test-specs/rst-test-specs.html#test-plans>.
  enum:
#exec sed 's/^/    /' tmp/test-plan-mnemonics.yaml

dueDate:
  description: |
    The date/time before which the test must be passed. If not provided, the
    test remains open indefinitely (unless the `completed` status is reached).

    In OT&E, this **MUST** be omitted.
  type: string
  format: date-time
