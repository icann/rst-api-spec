rsp:
  description: |
    The RSP's unique ID.

    In OT&E, this **MUST** be omitted when creating a new IDN table,
    and will be populated using the FQDN of the first `TLSA` record
    which matches the certificate presented by the client.
  type: string
  example: RSPI2404-M51

tag:
  description: |
    The language tag, which **MUST** conform to the specification in [RFC
    5646](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5646.html).
  type: string
  example: ar-Arab

version:
  description: The version number.
  type: string
  example: "1.0"

eppSafeCodePoints:
  description: |
    A list of sequences that are "safe" for the purposes of pseudo-random
    generation of domain names in TLDs that use this table.

    Some test cases require the generation and creation of domain names with
    pseudo-randomly generated names. In TLDs whose value of the `idnOnly`
    property is `false`, ASCII letters and digits will be used.

    However, for TLDs for which this value is `true`, this list provides a set
    of characters that can be used to generate domain names.

    Each item in the array is a string containing one or more code points,
    separated by spaces.
  type: array
  minItems: 3
  items:
    type: string
    pattern: >-
      ^U\\+[0-9a-fA-F]+(?: U\\+[0-9a-fA-F]+)*$
    example: U+0047

isReferenceLGR:
  description: |
    Whether the RSP's implementation of the IDN table uses a Second-
    Level Reference Label Generation Rules (LGRs) developed by ICANN.

permittedVariantPolicies:
  description: |
    The variant policies supported for this table. This is an array of strings
    whose permitted values are:

    * `novar` - no variants are supported/applicable
    * `allblockvar` - all variants are blocked
    * `mayallocatevar` - variants may be allocated
